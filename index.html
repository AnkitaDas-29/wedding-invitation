            Not Just an <br />
            Ordinary Love Story
          </h3>
          <p class="text reveal">
            It was a typical an evening in Jerusalem, Israel, when Dr.
            Subhasish, a post-doc researcher from West Bengal, India, decided to
            take a break from his lab work and browse through a matrimonial
            site. Meanwhile, in Durgapur, India, Ankita, a digital marketing
            professional, was reluctantly opening a free account on the same
            site, only to humor her worried family who were eager to see her
            settled. As fate would have it, Subhasish stumbled upon Ankita's
            profile and was immediately drawn to her bright smile and sparkling
            eyes. He sent her a casual "Hi, hello!" message, not expecting much
            in return. But to his surprise, Ankita responded, and they started
            chatting. Their initial conversations were light-hearted and casual,
            but as they continued to talk, they discovered a deep connection.
            They shared stories about their families, their passions, and their
            dreams. Subhasish was captivated by Ankita's confidence and
            determination, while Ankita admired Subhasish's kind heart and sense
            of humor. As their friendship blossomed, they realized that they had
            found something special. They started talking every day, sharing
            their joys and sorrows, and supporting each other through thick and
            thin. Months went by, and their connection grew stronger. They
            decided to meet in person, and Subhasish flew to Kolkata to take
            Ankita on a romantic date. The sparks flew, and they knew that they
            were meant to be together. Subhasish and Ankita are getting married,
            surrounded by their loved ones. They are grateful for that chance
            encounter on the matrimonial site, which led them to each other.
            Their love story is a testament to the power of fate and the magic
            of online connections.
